# Python Data Science Assignment Guide

## What Maeva Wants You to Do

Based on the conversation, Maeva is asking you to:

1. **Complete Python assignments** from the Data Science course
2. **Push your work to your own GitHub account** 
3. **Send her the link** to your completed repository

## Understanding the Assignment Process

### Step 1: Access the Course Materials
The GitHub repository she shared contains course materials:
- **Repository:** https://github.com/kseniiailchenko/Python_for_Data_Science
- **Content:** All materials for the course "Python for Data Science, EDC"

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment âœ…
I've already set up your local environment with:
- Python 3.11.0
- Essential data science packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding

### Step 3: Complete the Assignments
You should:
1. **Download/Clone** the course repository
2. **Work through** the assignments in the repository
3. **Create your own solutions** in Jupyter notebooks
4. **Document your work** with explanations and insights

### Step 4: Push to GitHub
1. **Create a new GitHub repository** for your assignments
2. **Upload your completed work**
3. **Share the link** with Maeva

## Getting Started Right Now

### Option 1: Start with the Sample Assignment
I've created a sample assignment notebook (`assignments/assignment_1_data_exploration.ipynb`) that you can:
1. Open and run to practice
2. Use as a template for real assignments
3. Learn the basic workflow

### Option 2: Access the Original Course Materials
```bash
# Clone the course repository
git clone https://github.com/kseniiailchenko/Python_for_Data_Science.git
```

### Option 3: Start Jupyter Notebook
```bash
# Start Jupyter to work on assignments
jupyter notebook
```

## Typical Assignment Structure

Most Data Science assignments follow this pattern:

1. **Data Loading** - Import and examine datasets
2. **Data Exploration** - Understand data structure and quality
3. **Data Cleaning** - Handle missing values, outliers, etc.
4. **Data Visualization** - Create charts and graphs
5. **Statistical Analysis** - Perform calculations and tests
6. **Machine Learning** - Build predictive models
7. **Documentation** - Explain your findings and code

## Next Steps

1. **Decide which approach** you want to take (sample assignment vs. original course materials)
2. **Start working** on the assignments
3. **Ask for help** if you get stuck on specific concepts
4. **Create your GitHub repository** when ready to submit
